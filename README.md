# MIT-machine
This repository provides a VHDL language program to synthesize a computer based on the machine provided by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
<br/>
<br/>
## Elements
The program includes four elements: Package, Component, Simple Computer, and Machine.
<br/>
<br/>
Package contains several basic operations, such as binary to integer, addition and multiplication. Component contains various computer circuits, such as full adder, decoder and register. Simple Computer contains several mathematical operations for a basic computer, such as multiplexer and decrementer. Machine contains some advanced operations, such as instruction memory and arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language and IDE
The program is written in VHDL language. It is compiled and synthesized with Active-HDL 7.2.
